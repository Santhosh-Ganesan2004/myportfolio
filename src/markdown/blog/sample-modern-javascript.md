# ðŸš€ Modern JavaScript Features You Should Know

JavaScript has evolved rapidly in recent years, introducing new features that simplify code and improve performance. In this post, you'll discover some of the most useful modern JavaScript features every developer should know, with clear examples and explanations.

---

## 1. Arrow Functions

Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing functions and automatically bind the context:

```js
// Traditional function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## 2. Template Literals

Template literals make string interpolation and multi-line strings easier and more readable:

```js
const name = 'Santi';
console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); // Hello, Santi!
```

---

## 3. Destructuring Assignment

Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects in a clean, readable way:

```js
const user = { name: 'Santi', age: 25 };
const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name); // Santi
console.log(age);  // 25
```

---

## 4. Spread and Rest Operators

Spread (`...`) and rest (`...`) operators simplify working with arrays and objects:

```js
// Spread example
const arr1 = [1, 2];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4]; // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Rest example
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
}
```

---

## 5. Optional Chaining

Optional chaining (`?.`) helps avoid errors when accessing deeply nested properties:

```js
const user = {};
console.log(user.profile?.email); // undefined, no error
```

## âœ¨ Conclusion

Modern JavaScript features make your code cleaner, safer, and more expressive. Start using them in your projects to boost productivity and code quality!
